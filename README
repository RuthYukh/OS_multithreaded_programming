MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique used for handling large-scale data processing tasks, particularly in distributed systems.
The model breaks down a large task into smaller subtasks and distributes them across multiple processors. It operates in two main phases: Map and Reduce.

The input is given as a sequence of elements.
During the Map phase, the map function is applied to each input element, producing a sequence of
intermediary elements.
Next, the sort/shuffle phases get intermediary elements sorted into new sequences.
Then in the reduce phase, the reduce function is applied to each of the sorted sequences of
intermediary elements, producing a sequence of output elements.
Finally the output is a concatenation of all sequences of output elements.
